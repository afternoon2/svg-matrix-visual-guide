SVG `matrix` is a transformation function that [maps coordinates from a previous coordinate system into a new coordinate system](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/transform).

It takes six parameters - `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e` and `f`, where odd elements (`a`, `c` and `e`) are modifying the next `X` coordinate, while the even ones (`b`, `d` and `f`) do the same with the `Y` coordinate.

The matrix function is applied to every point that creates a shape. In case of a rectangle (like in this app), it transforms the `topLeft`, `topRight`, `botttomRight` and `bottomLeft` corners.

You can check this process using every part of the UI.
