Here we can see the process in a little bit mathy way.

Horizontal axis modifiers are placed on top, while vertical on the bottom. `a` is multiplied by the current point's `X` value. `b` on the bottom does the same. That's how the first transformation step is made.

Then we add `c × Y` and `d × Y` to them (second step). The transformation is done after adding `e` and `f` respectively.
